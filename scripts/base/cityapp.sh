# CityApp module
# This module is to calculate the fastest way from "from_points" to "to_points" thru "via_points".
# The network is the road network, with user-defined average speed.
# Defining "from_points" is mandatory, "via_points" and "to_points" are optional.
# If no "to_points" are selected, the default "to_points" will used: points along the roads, calculated by the application.
