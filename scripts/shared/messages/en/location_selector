First have to add an area (such as country) to the dataset. \n If you do not want to add a new area, you may skip this step.  \n Adding a new area may take a long time, depending on the file size.\n In the selection window, zoom to the sub-area of your interest, then use Polygon drawing tool to exactly define that. \n Finally save your selection, name it, define the resolution and close the window.
There is an already defined area. \n Now you can refine your selection, or you can import a new map (creating a new location)
Select OSM data
No requested map found. \n points.gpkg, lines.gpkg and polygons.gpkg has to be found in ~/cityapp/geoserver_data/saved.
No lines map found in PERMANET mapset, or lines map is damaged. \n To resolve this error, add again your location (map) to CityApp.
Now the Location Selector is starting. Zoom to area of your interest, then use drawing tool to define your location. Next, save your selection. After saving your selection, close the window.
Now you can set the resolution value. \n The value you declare, will used by each CityApp module.
Geoserver administration window will now open. \n Log in and set manually the global_raster coordinates (see CityApp manual)
