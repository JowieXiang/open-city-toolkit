Select a map to add to CityApp. Map has to be in Open Street Map format -- osm is the only accepted format.
File is not osm file, or filename is without extension. CityApp accept only Open Streetmap files in osm or pbf format. osm or pbf extension is requested.
There is an already defined area. Do you want to reshape the existing selection? If do not want reshape the selection, bceause you want to replace the entire location, select No.
