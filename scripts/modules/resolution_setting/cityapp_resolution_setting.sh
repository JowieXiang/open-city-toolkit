# Projection is epsg:4326-ot. Therefore, even the user gives the resolutiion in mteres, we have to pass its value to GRASS in decimal degrees.
# Therefore, input always first goes to "bc". 111322 meters = 1°

# Messages 1 Type the resolution in meters, you want to use. For further details see manual.
